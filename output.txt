The `sqlite3.DatabaseError: database disk image is malformed` error indicates that your SQLite database file is corrupted.

To fix this, you can try deleting the corrupted `db.sqlite3` file and then running `python manage.py migrate` again to recreate a fresh database. This approach assumes that you do not have critical data in your current development database that you need to preserve.

Would you like me to proceed with this solution?
